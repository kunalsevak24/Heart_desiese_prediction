Predicting Heart Disease with Machine Learning: Our Latest Findings

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, but early detection and prevention can significantly reduce its impact. That's why we studied heart disease analytics and predictive modeling using various machine learning algorithms.

Our analysis was based on vast healthcare data, including 18 critical medical parameters such as age, sex, diabetes, sleep time, BMI, health, and race. We used logistic regression, KNN, decision trees, and random forest to develop predictive models and explored the data using feature analytics.

We transformed the data using Python Pandas, creating dummy variables, handling null values, reducing dimensionality, and removing outliers for better model learning. We conducted feature analysis using correlation functionality and data visualization with the Seaborn library in Python.

After modeling with training, testing, and validation data using the smote method for oversampling and building a data pipeline with onehotcoder and standard scaler, we evaluated the models. The logistic regression model had the highest accuracy for predicting whether a person has heart disease based on all the variables. We analyzed which variables were most closely linked to the prediction.

Our findings have important implications for healthcare providers, policymakers, and individuals at risk of heart disease. By leveraging machine learning and exploratory data analytics, we can improve our understanding of heart disease and develop more effective prevention and treatment strategies.
